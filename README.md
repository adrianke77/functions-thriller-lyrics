# Functions - Printing "Thriller" Lyrics

Today you're going to learn functions by writing a program to print out the
lyrics to Michael Jackson's famous son, "Thriller."

The entire song lyrics have been included in a file `lyrics.js`.
Your job is to format `lyrics.js` into a valid JavaScript program that prints
out all the lyrics.

You can run the program in your terminal with this command:

```
node lyrics.js
```

Your program should satisfy the following requirements:
- it should print out every verse and chorus in the song.
- it should reduce redundancy by encapsulating reoccurring code in functions.
- functions should have good, descriptive names.
- your program should call all the functions in one place at the top of the
  file.

Write your program. Run your program. Turn up your speakers and rock out.
